#### Proudly presented to you by team Ekspansyion :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

COVID-19 has affected every individual’s everyday lifestyle in one way or the other including personal and professional life, mental wellbeing, interaction with families, social life, etc. Focusing on the **Mental Health** issue, our team Ekspanyion, consisting of 3 members, *Philip Lee Hann Yung, Lee Wai Yeong* and *Lee Jinhen*, embarked on a journey of a lifetime to play our part in combating this issue by spurring our ideas via the SAP Cloud Track. Using PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we have developed a web application that caters to the mental wellbeing of our users. Our app showcases many ways to release stress and find out more about your mental health. The integrated chatbot within our web app is developed using SAP's proprietary Conversational AI platform.

Several one-of-its-kind features have been implemented into this web application. These features include imagery meditation, soothing music playlist, fun destressing videos and videos for laughs! Users will find themselves immersed in a sanctuary of calmness. Everybody needs a rest from time to time. To enhance engagement with the users, there is a point-based in-game reward system, in which users can exchange accumulated points for a cute plushie.
