We are working on the SAP Cloud Track about Mental health. Using PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we have developed a web application that caters to the mental wellbeing of our users. Our app showcases many ways to release stress and find out more about your mental health. The integrated chatbot within our web app is developed using SAP's proprietary Conversational AI platform.

For the Chatbot Bubbly Bot, he is equipped with basic conversational skills such as greetings, and could sense whether a user is angry, sad, happy or feeling depressed. When the user prompts a depression, sad or lonely message, Bubbly Bot will provide emotional and motivational support via motivational quotes and a helpline. Whenver the user is feeling down and under, Bubbly Bot will be there to comfort the user until he/she cheers up, and acts as a companion to support the user through ups and downs.

Features include imagery meditation, soothing music playlist, fun destressing videos and videos for laughs! Users will find themselves immersed in a sanctuary of calmness. Everybody needs a rest from time to time. To enhance engagement with the users, there is an point-based in-game reward system, in which users can exchange accumulated points  for a cute plushie.
